# Statistical-Models-and-Methods

This is a statistical report in module MATH2011 *Statistical Models and Methods* which is counted as coursework2 in this module. In this report, I worked as a risk analyst for a bank, making lending decisions on loan applications. Data are available on the credit score of 1000 individuals, together with the values of 20 explanatory variables for each individual.
